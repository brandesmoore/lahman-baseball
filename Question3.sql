	FACTS ::

        Use (people) p.playerid, namefirst, namelast - 19112 records

	(collegplaying) c.playerid, schoolid - 17350 records (there are 2000 NULL records in schoolid on the collegeplayingtable)

	(salaries) s.playerid, salary - 26428 records; there are instances of one player having multiple salaries (i.e. David Price, Pedro Alvarez) due to playing on diff teams

	(schools) sc.schoolid, schoolname - 1207 records

	DESCRIPTION ::

        Definitons from README 

		do a check from the people, collegeplaying, salaries and schools tables 

		

		I pulled p.playerid, namefirst & namelast from the people table,

		c.schoolid from the collegeplaying table, - 7550 records after taking out NULLs

		s.salary from the salaries table

		sc.schoolname form the schools table



		I created a subquery linking the four tables through a LEFT JOIN to account for players that played for multiple teams and earned a salary on each team.

		I included a SUM of the salaries, used COALESCE to apply a value of $0 where there were NULL values in the salary table.

		CAST double precison to numeric and then money to make the column readable in dollars

		WHERE schoolid ILIKE '%vand%'

		ORDER BY salary DESC places the highest salary at the top of the records


	ANSWER: David Price is the Vanderbilt player that earned the highest total salary, $81,851,296, in the majors.
